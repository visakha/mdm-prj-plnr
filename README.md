## Branch 001
```text
    commit msg: done- good state, close branch 001
    code written by Google Gemini. the prompt file is not uploaded to this project here.
    it did a decent job.
    to fix: the Add Phase, Add Epic and Add Task are not showing a dialog box to add the item name, desc, assigned to, status and due date
        once the user adds the inputs, it should add it to the approp hierarchy and persist to the DB
```

## Branch 002
```text
    prompt: 
    modify the functionality of the buttons Add Phase, Add Epic and Add Task. these buttons should open a dialog box for the task
        The shape of the task is same as the Model Task
        once the user adds the inputs the task, it should add it to the appropriate hierarchy and persist to the DB
```
